# Mixed Messages Challenge
For my mixed messages project I will be creating a football match results program that will randomly generate scores for use in a game like Fifa.

## Introduction
My football match results program is a program that would be used on a football game like Fifa where in a career or tournament mode it is needed to create random match scores whilst you play through the seasons. This program will be the bare bone functionality just to create the random match scores. As I gain more knowledge of Javascript I would like to create more complex functionality to the programme for example:
* Yellow and red cards
* Shots on goal
* Shots on Target
* Corners

The football League I will be using for this program will be based on the English Premier League.
## Technologies
My Mixed messages project is created with:
* Javascript
* Visual Studio Code
* Git & GitHub

## Finish Date
The finish date I am aiming for is Tuesday 8th February 2022.
